# Cypress-Session
The Cypress session command is one of the most important features in Cypress. Usually we might repeat the login action in our test automation; this might increase our automation execution time. To overcome this problem, we can use the Cypress session command. Using this command, you can login to the app only once, and the session details will be stored and used for further logins. This command will cache and restore cookies, local storage, and session storageÂ in order to reduce test setup times.
